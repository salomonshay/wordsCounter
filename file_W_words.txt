 The study of natural language processing, often called NLP, is a fascinating field. NLP focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. When we analyze text, the first step is often to count the frequency of every word. Counting words helps us understand the importance and use of each word within the text corpus. For example, a simple word like 'the' will appear far more frequently than a specific noun like 'algorithm.' A reliable word counter must handle punctuation and capitalization correctly to provide accurate results. We use this method for analysis of large amounts of text data.
